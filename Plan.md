# Plan

## What did I do next:

### Backend
1. clear database design, relation between url and user
2. clear role in the system, guess vs signed-in user
3. apply clean-architecture => in progress
- check where JwtModule is placed
- 
4. setup circle-ci for unit test => OK

5. 
  5.1 1st Option: how to automatically delete record on postgresql at an expected time
  will delete when we found that an shortened link requested by an user has expired
  - using `pg_cron` extension
  - using `pgAgent` extension
  - using `pg_schedule` extension
  - using `pg_timetable` extension
  5.2 2nd Option: 
  - expose an endpoint to list all expired links and delete them
  - implement a simple batch job to send request to the endpoint above
### Frontend
1. using gatsby to implement UI
2. base UI to short a link
3. list of shorten links related to a signed-in user, shorten link will expire in 1 months
4. list of 10 shorten links generated by guess to guessed, shorten link will expire in 24 hours
