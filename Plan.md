# Plan

## What did I do next:
### Backend
1. clear database design, relation between url and user
2. clear role in the system, guess vs signed-in user
3. apply clean-architecture => in progress
- check where JwtModule is placed
- 
4. setup circle-ci for unit test
5. how to automatically delete record on postgresql at an expected time
  5.5 will delete when we found that an shortened link requested by an user has expired
  5.1 using `pg_cron` extension
  5.2 using `pgAgent` extension
  5.3 using `pg_schedule` extension
  5.4 using `pg_timetable` extension

### Frontend
1. using gatsby to implement UI
2. base UI to short a link
3. list of shorten links related to a signed-in user, shorten link will expire in 1 months
4. list of 10 shorten links generated by guess to guessed, shorten link will expire in 24 hours
